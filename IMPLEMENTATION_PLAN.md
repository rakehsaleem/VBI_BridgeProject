# Domain Adaptation Implementation Plan

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Modify Data Loader ✅ (First Priority)
**Goal**: Separate source and target domains, handle partial labels
- Modify `cnn_data_loader.py` to:
  - Load source domains (3 bridges) with full labels
  - Load target domain (1 bridge) with partial labels
  - Track bridge ID for each sample
  - Separate labeled/unlabeled data in target domain

### Step 2: Build Feature Extractor Base
**Goal**: Create shared CNN encoder for all domains
- Extract from existing CNN model
- Output: Feature embeddings (batch, feature_dim)
- Will be used by all downstream components

### Step 3: Implement Bridged-Graph Construction
**Goal**: Connect similar samples across domains
- K-nearest neighbor search
- Distance metrics (Euclidean/cosine)
- Build graph structure (edges, weights)

### Step 4: Implement Graph Knowledge Transfer (GAT Layer)
**Goal**: Aggregate features from connected samples
- Graph Attention Network layer
- Multi-head attention mechanism
- Knowledge-enhanced feature representation

### Step 5: Implement Domain Discriminator
**Goal**: Adversarial training to align domains
- 4-way classifier (bridge IDs)
- Gradient reversal layer
- Domain confusion loss

### Step 6: Build Complete Model Architecture
**Goal**: Integrate all components
- Combine: Encoder → Graph → Aggregation → Classifier
- Multi-task learning setup
- Loss function combination

### Step 7: Training Loop Implementation
**Goal**: Multi-stage training procedure
- Stage 1: Pre-train on source domains
- Stage 2: Domain adaptation training
- Stage 3: Fine-tuning on target

### Step 8: Semi-Supervised Learning
**Goal**: Use unlabeled target data
- Pseudo-labeling mechanism
- Self-training loop
- Confidence-based selection
