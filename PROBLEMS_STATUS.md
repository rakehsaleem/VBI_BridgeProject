# Problem Status Check

## 1. Domain Alignment Too Aggressive
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**
- Current: β = 0.1 (weak domain alignment)
- Previous: Implicit strong alignment (73% discriminator accuracy)
- Action: Already set optimal parameter

## 2. Bridged-Graph Not Used
**Status**: ❌ **NOT FIXED**
- Current: Graph is built (50,000 edges) but NOT used in training
- Issue: Knowledge transfer through graph connections not implemented
- Action: **NEED TO FIX** - Integrate graph attention/knowledge aggregation

## 3. Loss Imbalance
**Status**: ⚠️ **PARTIALLY FIXED**
- Current: 
  - Loss weights: α=1.0, β=0.1 ✓
  - Sample weights: 3x for target ✓
- Issue: Should verify both are working correctly
- Action: **VERIFY and ENHANCE**

## 4. Target Underrepresented
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**
- Current: TARGET_SAMPLE_WEIGHT = 3.0 (target samples get 3x importance)
- Previous: No sample weighting
- Action: Already implemented

## Summary
- Fixed: 2/4 (Problems 1 & 4)
- Partially Fixed: 1/4 (Problem 3 - need verification)
- Not Fixed: 1/4 (Problem 2 - Bridged-Graph integration)

## Next Steps
1. Integrate Bridged-Graph knowledge transfer into training loop
2. Add graph attention mechanism for feature enhancement
3. Verify sample weights are correctly applied
4. Verify loss weights are correctly applied
